# Age Input and Output Program Explanation

This document explains the functionality of a Python program that takes an age input from the user and outputs it a specified number of times.

## Program Overview

The program consists of three main functions:

1. `main()`
2. `get_number()`
3. `output(num)`

Let's break down each function and its purpose.

### Main Function

```python
def main():
    num = get_number()
    output(num)
```

The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It:
1. Calls `get_number()` to obtain a valid age from the user.
2. Passes this age to the `output()` function to display the result.

### Get Number Function

```python
def get_number():
    while True:
        num = int(input("Enter Age: "))
        if num > 0:
            break
    return num
```

The `get_number()` function is responsible for getting a valid age input from the user:

- It uses a `while True` loop to keep prompting the user until a valid input is received.
- It attempts to convert the user's input to an integer.
- If the number is positive (greater than 0), it breaks out of the loop.
- After breaking out of the loop, it returns the valid number.

### Output Function

```python
def output(num):
    for _ in range(num):
        print(f"Your Age Is {num}")
```

The `output()` function takes the age as an input and prints a message that number of times:

- It uses a `for` loop that iterates `num` times.
- In each iteration, it prints the message "Your Age Is X", where X is the entered age.

## Program Execution

When you run this program:

1. You will be prompted to enter an age.
2. If you enter a non-positive number, you'll be asked to enter a number again.
3. Once a valid (positive integer) age is entered, the program will print "Your Age Is X" X number of times, where X is the age you entered.

Overall, this program demonstrates basic input validation and the use of functions to organize code in Python.
