# Square Number Program

## Overview

This Python program calculates and displays the square of a number entered by the user. It consists of two functions: 

- `square_number()`: This function prompts the user to input a number and passes it to another function to calculate its square.
- `display_square(num)`: This function takes the input number, calculates its square, and returns a formatted string showing the result.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a number.
2. The program calculates the square of the number by passing the input to the `display_square()` function.
3. The square of the number is then printed as a formatted message.

## Code Structure

- **square_number()**: 
  - Prompts the user to input a number.
  - Calls `display_square(num)` and prints the result.
  
- **display_square(num)**: 
  - Takes a number as an argument.
  - Calculates the square of the number.
  - Returns a string in the format: `"The square of [num] is [square]"`.

## Example

If the user inputs `5`, the output will be: `25`
