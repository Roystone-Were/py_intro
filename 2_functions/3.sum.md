# Sum of Two Numbers Program

## Overview

This Python program calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user. It consists of two functions:

- `sum()`: This function prompts the user to input two numbers and passes them to another function to calculate the sum.
- `display_sum(num1, num2)`: This function takes the two numbers, calculates their sum, and displays the result.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input two numbers.
2. The program calculates the sum of the two numbers using the `display_sum()` function.
3. The calculated sum is printed in a formatted message.

## Code Structure

- **sum()**: 
  - Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
  - Calls the `display_sum(num1, num2)` function to calculate and display the sum.
  
- **display_sum(num1, num2)**: 
  - Takes two numbers as arguments.
  - Calculates the sum using the formula:  
    \[
    \text{Sum} = \text{num1} + \text{num2}
    \]
  - Prints the result in the format:  
    `"Sum of [num1] and [num2] is [sum]."`

## Example

If the user inputs `7` and `3`, the output will be:
