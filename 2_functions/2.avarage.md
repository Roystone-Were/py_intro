# Average of Three Numbers Program

## Overview

This Python program calculates the average of three numbers entered by the user. It consists of two functions:

- `inputs()`: This function prompts the user to input three numbers and passes them to another function to calculate the average.
- `avarage(num1, num2, num3)`: This function takes the three numbers, calculates their average, and returns the result.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input three numbers.
2. The program calculates the average of the three numbers using the `avarage()` function.
3. The calculated average is printed in a formatted message.

## Code Structure

- **inputs()**: 
  - Prompts the user to enter three numbers.
  - Calls the `avarage(num1, num2, num3)` function to calculate the average.
  
- **avarage(num1, num2, num3)**: 
  - Takes three numbers as arguments.
  - Calculates the average using the formula:  
    \[
    \text{Average} = \frac{\text{num1} + \text{num2} + \text{num3}}{3}
    \]
  - Prints the result in the format:  
    `"The average of [num1], [num2], and [num3] is [average]."`

## Example

If the user inputs `5`, `10`, and `15`, the output will be:
