# Age and Number Checker Program

This Python program performs two main tasks based on user input:

1. **Age Categorization**: The program prompts the user for their name and age, and then categorizes the user as either a **Minor**, **Adult**, or **Senior** based on the input age.
   
2. **Number Evaluation**: The program also asks the user to input a number. It checks whether the number is **even** or **odd**. Additionally, it applies the **FizzBuzz logic**:
   - If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, it prints **FizzBuzz**.
   - If divisible by 3, it prints **Fizz**.
   - If divisible by 5, it prints **Buzz**.
   - If none of these, it prints the number as-is.

## Python Concepts Tested:

- **User Input**: Handling input using the `input()` function and manipulating strings (e.g., `capitalize()`, `strip()`).
- **Functions**: Modular design with functions like `main()`, `check_age()`, and `number_checker()` to organize code.
- **Conditionals**: Use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to handle different cases such as checking the age range and applying FizzBuzz logic.
- **Modulus Operator**: Applying the `%` operator to check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (used in both even/odd checks and FizzBuzz logic).
